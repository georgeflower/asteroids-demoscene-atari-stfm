 * 800x600 canvas scaled by 0.4).  game_render() maps it onto the playing field
 * rectangle of the real screen, so the world keeps its proportions on a 4:3 display.

 * Positions and velocities are 16.16 fixed point in world units per 50 Hz
 * frame.  Angles are 16-bit: 65536 is one full turn, 0 points right, and
 * increasing angles turn clockwise on screen (y grows downwards).
